Turns Bible references into links to the verse on Bible.logos.com

== Description ==

This plugin provides an easy way to use the RefTagger Bible reference tagging script from Logos Bible Software. It automatically modifies your site to run the script each time a page loads. The script identifies references to Bible verses and turns the references into links to the verse on bible.logos.com. Hovering over a link will display a small tooltip containing the text of the reference, so users don't need to leave the page to view the verse. If desired, a small icon can also be inserted next to the reference. Clicking the icon will open the specified verse in Libronix DLS, if available. The plugin provides a simple options page where you can customize search settings.

Customizable preferences include: 

* Which Bible version to link to.
* Option to insert a Libronix DLS link after each reference.
* Option to insert a Libronix icon after any Libronix DLS links you already have on your site.
* Choice of which icon to use if Libronix DLS links are enabled.
* Option to enable or disable hover tooltips.
* Option to override the default tooltip CSS & provide your own.
* Option to prevent searching user comments for references.
* Option to prevent searching specific HTML tags, such as bold, h1, ordered list, etc.
